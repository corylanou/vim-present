# Vim Present runtime files

Syntax Highlights the .slide and .article files for a [Go Present Tool](https://godoc.org/code.google.com/p/go.tools/present) files.  It currently supporst just a few things, such as Page Titles, play, link, code, and code blocks.  This tends to be enough for me, but I'm open to pull reuqests to add even more.

# Note

This is my first vim syntax file ever... it might be complete garbage, use as you see fit.
